The user wants to be well informed about the product as well as be able to ask question about the listings to have a better understand of who they dealing with, where the office space is located and how does that office space suit their needs. A number is included in the header navigation show that client is thinking about the user needs.</p>
            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>With a Black background the green and white color uniform text creates a calm and invite environment. The space between the logo and navigation and navigation and phone number is consistent as well as well aligned. The Green color was used for the logo/icons and for highlighted and important text. A san-serif font is used in the navigation bar making the text readable.</p>

            <h3>Design Critique:</h3>
            <p>The formation of the letters in the logo/name of the web site shares an artiest feel to that of the product the client is selling, as texts looks to be hand drawn or written as oppose to a san-serif text which has a more complete and finish field to it. The Larger text draws the attention of the user and leads them to the information located to the right of it. The background is a plain white with black and gray text, which is easy to read. The white space shows proximity, by separating or grouping certain functionalizes together, where on the right side of the header, it deals with the user accounts information. A black bar with white text is then used as the site main navigation. The black is used in contrast to the overall white background as it separates’ the header from the body text, as well as being used as the navigation. A search bar is provided so the user can quickly search for items. Small notification box are found above the certain categorize to notify the user that there is a sale, new items or what is currently the most popular art in stock. The Facebook and twitter icon were used because icon are easier to read and associate with the user.</p>
